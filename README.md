# Showcase K-Means Algorithm

A k-means toolkit with animation demos.

See the [MLHub
Survivor](https://survivor.togaware.com/mlhub/kmeans.html) chapter for
user details: https://survivor.togaware.com/mlhub/kmeans.html.

Besides the standard **demo** command, **train** can be used to
perform a cluster analysis of a dataset in a CSV file, and **predict**
can be used to apply the model to new data to place points into one of
the identified clusters.
