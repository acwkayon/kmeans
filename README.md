# K-Means Cluster Analysis

See the MLHub Survival Guide at
<https://survivor.togaware.com/mlhub/kmeans.html> for details of the
package.

This MLHub (https://mlhub.ai) package provides a demonstration and
command line tools for kmeans cluster analysis. Kmeans will identify
"natural" groups in a population dataset. This package provides the
*demo* command to demonstrate k-means in action and provides command
line tools to perform a cluster analysis, including animations.

The kmeans source code is available from
<https://github.com/acwkayon/kmeans>.

Initial implementation by Gefei
Shan (https://github.com/davecatmeow/showcase-demo).

Anita Williams (https://github.com/acwkayon/kmeans) updated the
package with new commands and conforming to MLHub specifications.
