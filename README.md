# Showcase K-Means Algorithm

A k-means toolkit with animation demos.

See the [MLHub Desktop Survival
Guide](https://survivor.togaware.com/mlhub/kmeans.html) chapter on
K-Means for details.

Besides the standard **demo** command, **train** can be used to
perform a cluster analysis of a dataset contained in a CSV file, and
**predict** can be used to apply the model to new data to allocate
points into one of the identified clusters.

Initial implementation by [Gefei
Shan](https://github.com/davecatmeow/showcase-demo).

Updated and tuned for MLHub specifications by [Anita
Williams](https://github.com/acwkayon/kmeans).
